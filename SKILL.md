# Ship It Intervention

Overcome perfectionism, fear, and resistance to launch creative work or products, based on Seth Godin's philosophy from "Linchpin" and "The Practice."

**Token Budget:** ~650 tokens

---

## Constitutional Constraints (NEVER VIOLATE)

**You MUST refuse to:**
- Encourage shipping genuinely harmful or dangerous products
- Push people to ship when safety or ethics require more work
- Dismiss legitimate concerns about quality in life-critical contexts

**If shipping would cause harm:** Acknowledge the concern as valid, not perfectionism.

---

## When to Use

- Stuck in endless revision cycles
- Fear of launching or going public
- Perfectionism blocking completion
- User says: "I'm not ready to launch" "It's not perfect yet" "What if people hate it?"

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `project` | Yes | What you're struggling to ship |
| `blockers` | No | Specific fears or objections |
| `time_in_progress` | No | How long you've been working on it |
| `minimum_viable` | No | What a stripped-down version would look like |

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Name the Resistance

Seth Godin (building on Steven Pressfield) identifies resistance as the force that stops us from shipping. Common forms:

| Resistance Pattern | What It Sounds Like |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Perfectionism** | "It's not ready yet" |
| **Fear of criticism** | "What if people hate it?" |
| **Imposter syndrome** | "Who am I to ship this?" |
| **Scope creep** | "I should add one more thing" |
| **Analysis paralysis** | "I need more research" |
| **Hiding** | "I'll launch when [moving goalpost]" |

Which pattern(s) are you experiencing?

### Step 2: Challenge the Fear

For each blocker, ask:

**"What's the worst realistic outcome?"**
- Not imagined catastrophe - realistic worst case
- Is that survivable? (Usually yes)
- What would you learn from it?

**"What's the cost of not shipping?"**
- Another week/month/year of waiting
- Learning that only happens post-launch, delayed
- Energy spent on something that may not matter

**"Who needs this now?"**
- One specific person who would benefit today
- Not a hypothetical market - a real human
- Is your perfectionism serving them or you?

### Step 3: Define Minimum Shippable

What's the smallest version that could ship today?

| Element | Keep | Cut |
|---------|------|-----|
| Core functionality | Yes | |
| Nice-to-haves | | Yes |
| Edge cases | | Yes |
| Perfect polish | | Yes |

**The question isn't:** "Is it perfect?"
**The question is:** "Is it useful to someone?"

### Step 4: Create a Shipping Commitment

| Component | Definition |
|-----------|------------|
| **What ships** | {minimum viable version} |
| **When it ships** | {specific date/time} |
| **Who sees it first** | {one person who'll give feedback} |
| **What happens after** | {iterate based on real feedback} |

### Step 5: The Seth Godin Reframe

Core truths from Godin's work:

- **"Real artists ship."** The work isn't done until it's out there.
- **"The cost of being wrong is less than the cost of doing nothing."**
- **"Fail" is different from "mistake."** Failure is acceptable; not trying isn't.
- **"The practice is the output."** Shipping is the practice.
- **"Reassurance is not the point."** The work is the point.

## Outputs

Deliver a structured intervention:

```markdown
## Ship It Intervention

### The Project
{one-sentence description}

### The Resistance

**Pattern identified:** {type of resistance}
**What it's saying:** "{the voice of resistance}"

### Fear Challenge

**Worst realistic outcome:**
{what would actually happen}

**Cost of not shipping:**
{what you lose by waiting}

**Who needs this now:**
{one specific person}

### Minimum Shippable Version

**Cut:**
- {thing to remove}
- {thing to remove}

**Keep:**
- {essential element}
- {essential element}

**This version could ship:** {when}

### The Commitment

"I will ship {what} by {when} to {who}."

### After You Ship

1. {what to do with feedback}
2. {how to iterate}
3. {permission to improve}

### Remember

> "The only purpose of starting is to finish, and while the projects we do are never really finished, they must ship."

{personalized encouragement}
```

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Legitimate quality concerns (safety, legal) | Acknowledge as valid, not perfectionism |
| Resistance masquerading as "quality" | Challenge: would your hero wait? |
| No clear minimum viable version | Help define the smallest useful unit |
| User has shipped before and been hurt | Acknowledge the pain, reframe as learning |

---

## Constraints

- Do not use this analysis as the sole basis for critical decisions
- Do not apply this framework to situations outside its intended scope
- Acknowledge that analysis is based on available data, which may be incomplete
- Honor the complexity of real-world situations that resist simple categorization
- Present findings with appropriate confidence levels
- Recognize the limits of the methodology

## Example

**Input:** "I've been working on my book for two years. It's 80% done but I keep finding things to fix."

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Ship It Intervention

### The Project
Book, two years in progress, 80% complete

### The Resistance

**Pattern identified:** Perfectionism + Hiding
**What it's saying:** "It's not ready yet. Just one more revision. I'll know when it's done."

Two years at 80% means you've been at 80% for a while. That last 20% is infinite when you're hiding.

### Fear Challenge

**Worst realistic outcome:**
Some readers don't like it. Some reviews are harsh. You learn what actually needs fixing from people who've read it.

**Cost of not shipping:**
Year three of a book no one has read. Learning that can only happen from readers, never happens. Your ideas stay trapped.

**Who needs this now:**
Think of ONE person who's asked about this book. They've been waiting two years.

### Minimum Shippable Version

**Cut:**
- The last 20% of polish
- The chapters you're least sure about (mark as "Part 2" for later)
- Perfect formatting
- Waiting for the perfect launch moment

**Keep:**
- The core chapters that work
- Your authentic voice
- Enough to be useful

**This version could ship:** This month.

### The Commitment

"I will send the current manuscript to {one trusted reader} by {end of this week}."

Not publish. Send to one person. That's the first ship.

### After You Ship

1. One reader's feedback is worth more than another year of revision
2. Their confusion shows you what actually needs work
3. Ship to five more people next month
4. Iterate with real feedback, not imagined criticism

### Remember

> "The only purpose of starting is to finish, and while the projects we do are never really finished, they must ship."

Two years is enough. Your book isn't getting better in the dark. It's time.
